                        Hi! I'm Cloie Dale! I am a current undergraduate student at the University of Alabama studying
                        computer science. I am also
                        a part of the Honors College and the Accelerated Masters Program (AMP).
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently serving
                        as a Senior Software Memeber on the Alabama Astrobotics team. 
                        This team designs an autonomous lunar mining rover to compete in the annual NASA Lunabotics Championship and won 
                        the 2024 Championship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also currently the Meeting Coordinator for ACM-W, the club for women in computer science on campus.
                        As meeting coordinator, I plan and setup social and holiday meetings thoughout the year. My favorite part
                        of this role is that I get the opportunity to teach other students about the women that built computer science. 
                    </p>

                    Currently, I am working as a Technology Security Intern at Southern Company focusing on security logging and data analytics. 
                    For Summer 2025, I will be switching to a role in software development internship focusing on data integrations 
                    for a wheel and spoke integration system. 
                </p>
                <p class="w3-margin-left" style="color: #190B28;">
                    After graduating with my masters in May 2026, I plan on persuing a career in software development or database managment.
                    I will be using my experince in my summer internship to determine which path I am best suited for. 
                    In software development, I would like to focus on autonmous robotics or embedded systems. However, for database
                    managment, I would like to focus on archive or library databases.

                    Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, watching new TV shows, and crocheting. 
                    I am from an large family being one of 9 siblings, so I frequently go home for birthdays, holidays, and other events. 
                    In my free time, I often pick a new show to watch and work on crochet projects. These projects have ranged from small stress
                    ball stuffed animals to queen sized blankets. The vast majority of these project are designated as gifts for my loved ones.
